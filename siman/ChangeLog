	* siman.c (gsl_siman_solve_many): changed the variable 'throw' to
 	'u' (for uniform-random-number) so that we can compile with c++
 	where throw is a reserved word.

	* siman.c: made the solving functions deterministic by removing
 	the random seed, gsl_ran_seed(time(0L)). When the function is
 	non-deterministic it is hard to debug and test (about 1 time in 20
 	the test would fail due to the randomness). We can let the user do
 	the seeding if they need that.

	* siman_test_driver.sh (LAST_ENERGY): fixed a typo; the tests now
	report well when they converge.

	* siman_test_driver.sh, Makefile.am (TESTS): added a test driver
	so that now "make check" does something interesting.
