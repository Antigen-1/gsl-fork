	* siman.c: made the solving functions deterministic by removing
 	the random seed, gsl_ran_seed(time(0L)). When the function is
 	non-deterministic it is hard to debug and test (about 1 time in 20
 	the test would fail due to the randomness). We can let the user do
 	the seeding if they need that.

	* siman_test_driver.sh (LAST_ENERGY): fixed a typo; the tests now
	report well when they converge.

	* siman_test_driver.sh, Makefile.am (TESTS): added a test driver
	so that now "make check" does something interesting.
