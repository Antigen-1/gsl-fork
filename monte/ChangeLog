	* miser_test.c, plain_test.c:
	fixed cut-n-paste-o that made tests take a LONG time.

	* miser.c, plain_test.c:
	miser.c - fix direction of comparison.  More verbose warning message
	(which will soon go away).
	plain_test.c: print the number of calls.

	* miser.c:
	Allow different methods of estimating the variances.  Start to validate
	the input and warn about exceptional cases.  This is actually interesting.

	* vegas.c:
	Do a better job of making sure bins is a multiple of boxes in the
	MODE_STRATIFIED case.

Mon Jul  6 21:18:58 1998  booth  <booth@planck.pha.jhu.edu>

	* miser.c: cut down on use malloc calls by reusing vectors.

	* miser.c, plain_test.c, Makefile.in:
	Fix monte to work correctly with gsl_monte_plain.  Also make plain_test.c
	print the right function name.

	* ChangeLog, Makefile.in:
	changelog file, required by gnu coding standards

Thu Jul  2 21:03:42 1998  booth  <booth@planck.pha.jhu.edu>

	* vegas.c, gsl_monte_plain.h, gsl_vegas.h, miser.c, miser_test.c, plain.c, plain_test.c, Makefile.am, gsl_monte.h:
	Add plain.c and gsl_monte_plain.h to do simple Monte-Carlo.
	Collect common definitions in gsl_monte.h.  Make gsl_monte_miser use
	gsl_monte_plain.  This is currently broken - I need to sort out factors
	and powers.

Thu Jul  2 16:46:48 1998  bjg  <bjg@planck.pha.jhu.edu>

	* Makefile.am, Makefile.in: added gsl_vegas_print.h to Makefile.am

Sun Jun 28 20:59:56 1998  bjg  <bjg@planck.pha.jhu.edu>

	* miser.c, miser_test.c, vegas.c, vegas_test.c, Makefile.am, Makefile.in, gsl_miser.h, gsl_vegas.h:
	converted everything from random to rng directory

Thu Jun 25 19:27:36 1998  booth  <booth@planck.pha.jhu.edu>

	* vegas-print.c, vegas_test.c, miser.c, miser_test.c, vegas.c, Notes, gsl_miser.h, gsl_vegas.h, gsl_vegas_print.h, Makefile.am:
	Add Monte-Carlo routines in the subdirectory monte. Currently provides
	VEGAS and an implementation of the MISER algorithm described in Numerical
	Recipes.
