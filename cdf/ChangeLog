	* gamma.c (gsl_cdf_gamma_P): Peizer and Pratt approximation for
	large a seems to be inaccurate in tails
	(gsl_cdf_gamma_Q): Peizer and Pratt approximation for large a
	seems to be inaccurate in tails

	* test.c (main): added test for large a for gamma

	* cauchyinv.c (gsl_cdf_cauchy_Qinv): corrected limiting value for
	Q=1

	* added Cumulative Distribution functions from savannah.gnu.org
