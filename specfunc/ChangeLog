	* added the return code as the second argument of GSL_WARNING, so
 	we can filter on the error number or output a standard message for
 	each one.

	* Makefile.am (include_HEADERS): added gsl_specfunc.h so it gets
	into the distribution.
	(INCLUDES): added -I$(top_srcdir) so that bessel.c can find
	gsl_math.h
