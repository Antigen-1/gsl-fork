The following constitute the set of things which
should be finished before a 1.0 level release.

* Implement the conicalP_sph_reg() functions.
  DONE: Fri Nov  6 23:33:53 MST 1998 [GJ]

* Implement toroidal functions, toroidalP_...().

* Irregular (Q) Legendre functions, at least
  the integer order ones. More general cases
  can probably wait.

* Make hyperg_1F1() work right.

* Implement the low-energy regime for the Coulomb
  wave functions. This is fairly well understood in
  the recent literature but will require some
  detailed work.

* Clean-up the Fermi-Dirac code. The full Fermi-Dirac
  functions can probably wait until a later release,
  but we should have at least the j = integer and
  j = 1/2-integer cases for the 1.0 release. The
  latter are not too hard.

* Go over the tests and make sure nothing is left out.

* Fill out our scorecard, working from Lozier's
  "Software Needs in Special Functions" paper.


----------------------------------------------------------------------

The following are important but probably involve
significant effort, and it is too much to expect
completion before a 1.0 level release.

* Characterize the algorithms. A significant fraction of
  the code is home-grown and it should be reviewed by
  other parties.


----------------------------------------------------------------------

The following are extra features which need not be implemented
for a version 1.0 release.

* Spheroidal wave functions.

* Mathieu functions.

* Weierstrass elliptic functions.
