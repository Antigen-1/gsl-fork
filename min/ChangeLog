	* test.c (test_bracket): fixed warning about "control reaches end
 	of non-void function" by changing return type to void

	* bracketing.c (gsl_min_find_bracket): changed counter nb_eval
 	from type int to type size_t in order to avoid comparison between
 	signed and unsigned, (nb_eval < eval_max).

	* made all internal functions static
