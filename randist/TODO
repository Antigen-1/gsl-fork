1. The exponential power distribution method could be speeded up by
using a rational function approximation for the rejection scaling
parameter.

x2. Check for off by one error in the shuffle algorithm. DONE. checked
against Knuth.

3. If the user runs gsl-dist for two different distributions then the
variates will be correlated because they come from the same stream of
random numbers.
