* The exponential power distribution method could be speeded up by
using a rational function approximation for the rejection scaling
parameter.

* Do something about the possibility of the user providing invalid
parameters (e.g. negative variance etc)

* Add the triangular distribution.

* fix error handling in discrete.c to use GSL_ERROR(), do the same
for memory management

* Look at Marsaglia & Tsang, "The Monte Python Method for generating
random variables", ACM TOMS Vol 24, No 3, p341
