	* made the 'gsl-dist' programs just output a single column of
 	their random numbers (previously some of the programs printed both
 	the uniform variate and the transformed number)

	* got rid of the 'bench-' programs. We will have a full testing
 	suite soon.

	* renamed the installed programs from 'dist' to 'gsl-dist' so that
 	they don't overwrite anything, e.g. it's possible the user might
 	have other programs called 'gauss' or 'gamma' installed in
 	/usr/local

	* laplace.c (gsl_ran_laplace): added a Laplace distribution
	(two-sided exponential)
	
	* lorentz.c (gsl_ran_lorentzian): added a Lorentz distribution

	* Makefile.am (lib_LIBRARIES): now it creates libgslrandist.a so
	that we have gaussian and poisson distributions.
