This chapter describes functions for performing quadrature or numerical
integration. The library reimplements algorithms from the QUADPACK
library by Piessens, Doncker-Kapenga, Uberhuber and Kahaner. Fortran
code for QUADPACK is available on Netlib.

All the functions attempt to compute an integral of the form

@tex
$$
I = \int_a^b f(x) dx
$$
@end tex
@ifinfo
@example
I = \int_a^b f(x) dx
@end example
@end ifinfo

@noindent
aiming to satisfy the accuracy requirement

@tex
$$
|RESULT - I|  \leq max \{ epsabs, epsrel |I| \}
$$
@end tex
@ifinfo
@example
|RESULT - I|  <= max @{ epsabs, epsrel |I| @}
@end example
@end ifinfo

@noindent
where RESULT is the numerical approximation obtained by the
algorithm. The integrators attempt to estimate the absolute error
@math{ABSERR = |RESULT - I|} in such a way that the following inequality
holds,

@tex
$$
|RESULT - I| \leq ABSERR \leq max \{ epsabs, epsrel |I| \}
$$
@end tex
@ifinfo
@example
|RESULT - I| <= ABSERR \leq max @{ epsabs, epsrel |I| @}
@end example
@end ifinfo

@section QNG non-adaptive Gauss-Kronrod integration

@deftypefun int gsl_integration_qng (const gsl_function *@var{f}, double @var{a}, double @var{b}, double @var{epsabs}, double @var{epsrel}, double * @var{result}, double * @var{abserr}, size_t * @var{neval})

This function applies the Gauss-Kronrod 10-point, 21-point, 43-point and
87-point integration rules in succession until an estimate of the
integral of @math{f} over @math{(a,b)} is achieved within the desired
absolute and relative error limits, @var{epsabs} and @var{epsrel}. The
function returns the final approximation, @var{result}, an estimate of
the absolute error, @var{abserr} and the number of function evaluations
used, @var{neval}. The Gauss-Kronrod rules are designed in such a way
that each rule uses all the results of its predecessors, in order to
minimise the total number of function evaluations.

The following book is the definitive reference for QUADPACK, being
written by the original developers. It describes the algorithms and
includes test programs, examples and useful advice on numerical
integration. It also has many references to the numerical integration
literature.
