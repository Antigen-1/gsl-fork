This file documents the @value{GSL}, a collection of numerical
routines for scientific computing.

As of @value{UPDATED}, the complete packages are the random number suite
(@pxref{Random Number Generation}), the quadrature package
(@pxref{Numerical Integration}), the FFT package (@pxref{Fast Fourier
Transforms}), the simulated annealing package (@pxref{Simulated
Annealing}) and the root finding package (@pxref{One dimensional Root-Finding}).  Work is under way on a special function library.

@chapter Preliminaries

The GNU Scientific Library (GSL) is a collection of routines for
numerical analysis.  The routines are written from scratch by the GSL
team (@pxref{Contributors to GSL}) in C, and are meant to present a
modern Applications Programming Interface (API) for C programmers, while
allowing wrappers to be written for very high level languages.

@appendix Copying

   The subroutines and source code in the @value{GSL} package are
``free''; this means that everyone is free to use them and free to
redistribute them on a free basis.  The @value{GSL}-related programs are
not in the public domain; they are copyrighted and there are
restrictions on their distribution, but these restrictions are designed
to permit everything that a good cooperating citizen would want to do.
What is not allowed is to try to prevent others from further sharing any
version of these programs that they might get from you.

   Specifically, we want to make sure that you have the right to give
away copies of the programs that relate to @value{GSL}, that you receive
source code or else can get it if you want it, that you can change these
programs or use pieces of them in new free programs, and that you know
you can do these things.

   To make sure that everyone has such rights, we have to forbid you to
deprive anyone else of these rights.  For example, if you distribute
copies of the @value{GSL}-related code, you must give the recipients all
the rights that you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or
can get the source code.  And you must tell them their rights.

   Also, for our own protection, we must make certain that everyone
finds out that there is no warranty for the programs that relate to
@value{GSL}.  If these programs are modified by someone else and passed
on, we want their recipients to know that what they have is not what we
distributed, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect
on our reputation.

   The precise conditions of the licenses for the programs currently
being distributed that relate to @value{GSL} are found in the General
Public Licenses that accompany them.
