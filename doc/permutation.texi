@cindex permutations

This chapter describes functions for creating and manipulating
permutations. A permutation @math{p} is represented by an array of
@math{n} integers in the range 0 .. @math{n-1}, where each value
@math{p_i} occurs once and only once.  The application of a permutation
@math{p} to a vector @math{v} yields a new vector @math{v'} where
@c{$v'_i = v_{p_i}$}
@math{v'_i = v_@{p_i@}}. 
For example, the array @math{(0,1,3,2)} represents a permutation
which exchanges the last two elements of a four element vector.
The corresponding identity permutation is @math{(0,1,2,3)}. 

The functions described in this chapter are defined in the header file
@file{gsl_permutation.h}.

@node The Permutation struct
@section The Permutation struct

A permutation is stored by a structure containing two members, the size
of the permutation and a pointer to the permutation array.  The elements
of the permutation array are all of type @code{size_t}.  The
@code{gsl_permutation} structure looks like this,

@example
typedef struct
@{
  size_t size;
  size_t * data;
@} gsl_permutation ;
@end example

@node Permutation allocation
@section Permutation allocation

@deftypefun {gsl_permutation *} gsl_permutation_alloc (size_t @var{n})
This function allocates memory for a new permutation of size @var{n}.
The permutation is not initialized and its elements are undefined.  Use
the function @code{gsl_permutation_calloc} if you want to create a
permutation which is initialized to the identity. A null pointer is
returned if insufficient memory is available to create the permutation.
@end deftypefun

@deftypefun {gsl_permutation *} gsl_permutation_calloc (size_t @var{n})
This function allocates memory for a new permutation of size @var{n} and
initializes it to the identity. A null pointer is returned if
insufficient memory is available to create the permutation.
@end deftypefun

@deftypefun void gsl_permutation_init (gsl_permutation * @var{p})
This function initializes the permutation @var{p} to the identity, i.e.
@math{(0,1,2,...,n-1)}.
@end deftypefun

@deftypefun void gsl_permutation_free (gsl_permutation * @var{p})
This function frees all the memory used by the permutation @var{p}.
@end deftypefun

@node Accessing permutation elements
@section Accessing permutation elements

The following functions can be used to access and manipulate
permutations.

@deftypefun size_t gsl_permutation_get (const gsl_permutation * @var{p}, const size_t @var{i})
This function returns the value of the @var{i}-th element of the
permutation @var{p}.  If @var{i} lies outside the allowed range of 0 to
@var{n}-1 then the error handler is invoked and 0 is returned.
@end deftypefun

@deftypefun int gsl_permutation_swap (gsl_permutation * @var{p}, const size_t @var{i}, const size_t @var{j})
This function exchanges the @var{i}-th and @var{j}-th elements of the
permutation @var{p}.
@end deftypefun

@node Permutation properties
@section Permutation properties

@deftypefun size_t gsl_permutation_size (const gsl_permutation * @var{p})
This function returns the size of the permutation @var{p}.
@end deftypefun

@deftypefun {size_t *} gsl_permutation_data (const gsl_permutation * @var{p})
This function returns a pointer to the array of elements in the
permutation @var{p}.
@end deftypefun

@deftypefun int gsl_permutation_valid (gsl_permutation * @var{p})
This function checks that the permutation @var{p} is valid.  The @var{n}
elements should contain each of the numbers 0 .. @var{n}-1 once and only
once.
@end deftypefun

@node Permutation functions
@section Permutation functions

@deftypefun void gsl_permutation_reverse (gsl_permutation * @var{p})
This function reverses the elements of the permutation @var{p}.
@end deftypefun

@deftypefun int gsl_permutation_invert (gsl_permutation * @var{inv}, const gsl_permutation * @var{p})
This function computes the inverse of the permuation @var{p}, storing
the result in @var{inv}.
@end deftypefun


@node Reading and writing permutations
@section Reading and writing permutations

The library provides functions for reading and writing permutations to a
file as binary data or formatted text.

@deftypefun int gsl_permutation_fwrite (FILE * @var{stream}, const gsl_permutation * @var{p})
This function writes the elements of the permutation @var{p} to the
stream @var{stream} in binary format.  The function returns
@code{GSL_EFAILED} if there was a problem writing to the file.  Since the
data is written in the native binary format it may not be portable
between different architectures.
@end deftypefun

@deftypefun int gsl_permutation_fread (FILE * @var{stream}, gsl_permutation * @var{p})
This function reads into the permutation @var{p} from the open stream
@var{stream} in binary format.  The permutation @var{p} must be
preallocated with the correct length since the function uses the size of
@var{p} to determine how many bytes to read.  The function returns
@code{GSL_EFAILED} if there was a problem reading from the file.  The
data is assumed to have been written in the native binary format on the
same architecture.
@end deftypefun

@deftypefun int gsl_permutation_fprintf (FILE * @var{stream}, const gsl_permutation * @var{p}, const char *@var{format})
This function writes the elements of the permutation @var{p}
line-by-line to the stream @var{stream} using the format specifier
@var{format}, which should be suitable for a type of @var{size_t}.  On a
GNU system the type modifier @code{Z} represents @code{size_t}, so
@code{"%Zu\n"} is a suitable format.  The function returns
@code{GSL_EFAILED} if there was a problem writing to the file.
@end deftypefun

@deftypefun int gsl_permutation_fscanf (FILE * @var{stream}, gsl_permutation * @var{p})
This function reads formatted data from the stream @var{stream} into the
permutation @var{p}.  The permutation @var{p} must be preallocated with
the correct length since the function uses the size of @var{p} to
determine how many numbers to read.  The function returns
@code{GSL_EFAILED} if there was a problem reading from the file.
@end deftypefun

@node Permutation Examples
@section Examples
The example program below creates a random permutation by shuffling and
finds its inverse.

@example
#include <stdio.h>
#include <gsl/gsl_rng.h>
#include <gsl/gsl_randist.h>
#include <gsl/gsl_permutation.h>

int 
main (void) 
@{
  const size_t N = 10 ;
  gsl_rng * r = gsl_rng_alloc (gsl_rng_env_setup()) ;

  gsl_permutation * p = gsl_permutation_alloc (N) ;
  gsl_permutation * p_inv = gsl_permutation_alloc (N) ;

  printf("initial permutation:") ;  
  gsl_permutation_init (p) ;
  gsl_permutation_fprintf (stdout, p, " %u") ;
  printf("\n") ;

  printf(" random permutation:") ;  
  gsl_ran_shuffle (r, p->data, p->size, sizeof(size_t));
  gsl_permutation_fprintf (stdout, p, " %u") ;
  printf("\n") ;

  printf("inverse permutation:") ;  
  gsl_permutation_invert (p_inv, p);
  gsl_permutation_fprintf (stdout, p_inv, " %u") ;
  printf("\n") ;
@}
@end example
@noindent
Here is the output from the program,

@example
bash$ ./a.out 
initial permutation: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
 random permutation: 1 3 5 2 7 6 0 4 9 8
inverse permutation: 6 0 3 1 7 2 5 4 9 8
@end example
@noindent
The random permutation @code{p[i]} and its inverse @code{q[i]} are
related through the identity @code{p[q[i]] = i}, which can be verified
from the output.
