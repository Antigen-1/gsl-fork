This chapter describes macros for the values of physical constants, such
as the speed of light, @math{c}, and gravitiational constant, @math{G}.
The values are available in different unit systems, including the
standard MKS system (meters, kilograms, seconds) and the CGS system
(centimeters, grams, seconds), which is commonly used in Astronomy.

The definitions of constants in the MKS system are available in the file
@file{gsl_const_mks.h}.  The constants in the CGS system are defined in
@file{gsl_const_cgs.h}.  Dimensionless constants, such as the fine
structure constant, which are pure numbers are defined in
@file{gsl_const_num.h}.
