	* gsl-design.texi: minor changes.

	* statistics.texi: removed the multiple descriptions of double,
 	int versions of the functions. Now we just describe the double
 	versions and note the existence of the corresponding versions for
 	other types.

	* ChangeLog: added a changelog file for the documentation,
 	although it is not required by the GNU Coding standards. I use the
 	Changelogs to keep track of pending changes that I need to commit
 	to repository.
