Almost all the special functions calculate an error estimate
along with the value of the result. Therefore, structures are
provided for amalgating a value and error estimate.

The gsl_sf_result struct contains value and error fields.

@example
typedef struct
@{
  double val;
  double err;
@} gsl_sf_result;
@end example


In some cases, an overflow or underflow can be detected
and handled by a function. In this case, it may be possible
to return a scaling exponent as well as an error/value pair.
The gsl_sf_result struct contains value and error fields as well
as an exponent field such that the actual result is obtained
as result * 10^(e10).

@example
typedef struct
@{
  double val;
  double err;
  int    e10;
@} gsl_sf_result_e10;
@end example
