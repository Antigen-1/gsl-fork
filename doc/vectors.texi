Unlike @sc{FORTRAN}, the C language does not provide support for vectors
or matrices with range checking. The functions described in this chapter
provide a simple vector and matrix interface to 

The functions for accessing the elements of a vector or matrix are
declared @code{extern inline} so there is no overhead in calling them.
If necessary you can turn off range checking completely by recompiling
your program.
