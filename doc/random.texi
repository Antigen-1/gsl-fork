@cindex random number generators

The @value{GSL} provides a large collection of random number generators
which can be accessed through a uniform interface. Environment variables
allow you to select different generators and seeds at runtime, so that
you can easily switch between generators without needing to recompile
your program. Each instance of a generator keeps track of its own state,
allowing the generators to be used in multi-threaded programs.
Additional functions are available for transforming uniform random
numbers into samples from continuous or discrete probability
distributions such as the gaussian, log-normal or poisson distributions.

@node General comments on random numbers
@section General comments on random numbers

In 1988, Park and Miller wrote a paper entitled ``Random number
generators: good ones are hard to find.'' [Commun. ACM, 31, 1192--1201].
Fortunately, some excellent random number generators are available,
though poor ones are still in common use.  You may be happy with the
system-supplied random number generator on your computer, but you should
be aware that as computers get faster, requirements on random number
generators increase.  Nowadays, a simulation that calls a random number
generator millions of times can often finish before you can make it down
the hall to the coffee machine and back.

A very nice review of random number generators was written by Pierre
L'Ecuyer, as Chapter 4 of the book: Handbook on Simulation, Jerry Banks,
ed. (Wiley, 1997).  The chapter is available in postscript from from
L'Ecuyer's ftp site (see references).  Knuth's volume on Seminumerical
Algorithms (originally published in 1968) devotes 170 pages to random
number generators, and is only now starting to show its age.
Nonetheless, it is brilliant, a classic.  If you don't own it, you
should stop reading right now, run to the nearest bookstore, and buy it.

A good random number generator will satisfy both theoretical and
statistical properties.  Theoretical properties are often hard to obtain
(they require real math!), but one prefers a random number generator
with a long period, low serial correlation, and a tendency @emph{not} to
``fall mainly on the planes.''  Statistical tests are performed with
numerical simulations.  Generally, a random number generator is used to
estimate some quantity for which the theory of probability provides an
exact answer.  Comparison to this exact answer provides a measure of
"randomness".

@node Random number generator initialization
@section Random number generator initialization

It is important to remember that a random number generator is not a
"real" function like sine or cosine.  Unlike real functions, successive
calls to a random number generator yield different return values.  Of
course that is just what you want for a random number generator, but to
achieve this effect, the generator must keep track of some kind of
"state" variable.  Sometimes this state is just an integer (sometimes
just the value of the previously generated random number), but often it
is more complicated than that and may involve a whole array of numbers,
possibly with some indices thrown in.  To use the random number
generators, you do not need to know the details of what comprises the
state, and besides that varies from algorithm to algorithm.

The random number generator library uses two special structs,
@code{gsl_rng} and @code{gsl_rng_type}. The struct @code{gsl_rng_type}
holds generic information about an algorithm, or type of generator. The
struct @code{gsl_rng} contains an instance of a generator created from
the specifications in a given @code{gsl_rng_type}.

The random number functions described in this section are declared in
the header file @file{gsl_rng.h}.

@deftypefn Random {gsl_rng *} gsl_rng_alloc (gsl_rng_type * @var{T})
This function returns a pointer to a newly-created
instance of a random number generator of type @var{T}.
For example, the following code creates an instance of the Tausworthe
generator,

@example
gsl_rng * r = gsl_rng_alloc (gsl_rng_taus);
@end example

If there is insufficient memory to create the generator then the
function returns a null pointer and the error handler is invoked with an
error code of @code{GSL_ENOMEM}.

The generator is automatically initialized with the
default seed, @code{gsl_rng_default_seed}. This is zero
by default but can be changed using the C variable
@code{gsl_rng_default_seed} or the environment variable
@code{GSL_RNG_SEED}, @pxref{Random number environment variables}.

The defined generator types are,

@example
gsl_rng_cmlib, gsl_rng_cmrg, gsl_rng_minstd,
gsl_rng_mrg, gsl_rng_mt19937, gsl_rng_r250,
gsl_rng_ran0, gsl_rng_ran1, gsl_rng_ran2, gsl_rng_ran3,
gsl_rng_rand, gsl_rng_rand48, gsl_rng_randu,
gsl_rng_ranf, gsl_rng_ranlux, gsl_rng_ranlux389,
gsl_rng_ranmar, gsl_rng_taus, gsl_rng_tds,
gsl_rng_tt800, gsl_rng_uni, gsl_rng_uni32, gsl_rng_vax,
gsl_rng_zuf
@end example
@end deftypefn

@deftypefn Random void gsl_rng_set (const gsl_rng * @var{r}, unsigned long int @var{s})
This function initializes (or `seeds') the random number
generator. If the random number generator is seeded with
the same value of @var{s} on two different runs, the
same stream of random numbers will be generated (by
successive calls to the routines below). If different
values of @var{s} are supplied, then the generated
streams of random numbers should be completely
different. If the seed @var{s} is zero then the standard
seed from the original implementation is used instead.
For example, the Fortran source code for the original
@code{ranlux} generator used a seed of 314159265, and so
choosing @var{s} equal to zero reproduces this.
@end deftypefn

@deftypefn Random void gsl_rng_free (gsl_rng * @var{r})
This function frees all the memory associated with the generator
@var{r}.
@end deftypefn

@node  Sampling from a random number generator
@section Sampling from a random number generator

The following functions return uniformly distributed random numbers,
either as integers or double precision floating point numbers. To obtain
non-uniform distributions @pxref{Random Number Distributions}.

@deftypefn Random {unsigned long int} gsl_rng_get (const gsl_rng * @var{r})
This function returns a random integer from the generator @var{r}.  All
integers in the range [@var{min},@var{max}] are equally likely.  The
maximum and minimum values, @var{max} and @var{min}, depend on the
algorithm used. They can determined using the auxilliary functions
@code{gsl_rng_max (r)} and @code{gsl_rng_min (r)}.
@end deftypefn

@deftypefn Random double gsl_rng_uniform (const gsl_rng * @var{r})
This function returns a double precision floating point number uniformly
distributed in the range [0,1), including 0.0 but excluding 1.0. The
value is typically obtained by dividing the result of
@code{gsl_rng_get(r)} by @code{gsl_rng_max(r) + 1.0} in double
precision. Some generators compute this ratio internally so that they
provide floating point numbers with more than the 32 bits of randomness
than can be represented in a single @code{unsigned long int}.
@end deftypefn

@deftypefn Random double gsl_rng_uniform_pos (const gsl_rng * @var{r})
This function returns a positive double precision floating point number
uniformly distributed in the range (0,1), excluding both 0.0 and 1.0.
The number is obtained by sampling the generator using the same
algorithm as @code{gsl_rng_uniform} until a non-zero value is obtained.
You can use this function if you need to avoid a singularity at 0.0.
@end deftypefn

@deftypefn Random {unsigned long int} gsl_rng_uniform_int (const gsl_rng * @var{r}, unsigned long int @var{n})
This function returns a random integer from 0 to @var{n-1} inclusive.
All integers in the range [0,@var{n-1}] are equally likely, regardless
of the generator used. An offset correction is applied so that this
function returns zero with the correct probability even if the
underlying generator has a minimum value of 1 and cannot return zero.

If @var{n} is larger than the range of the generator then the function
calls the error handler with an error code of @code{GSL_EINVAL} and
returns zero.
@end deftypefn

@node Auxiliary random number generator functions
@section Auxiliary random number generator functions
The following functions provide information about an existing
generator. You should use them in preference to hard-coding the generator
parameters into your own code.

@deftypefn Random {const char *} gsl_rng_name (const gsl_rng * @var{r})
This function returns a pointer to the name of the generator.
For example,
@example
printf("r is a '%s' generator\n", gsl_rng_name (r)) ;
@end example
@noindent
would print something like @code{r is a 'taus' generator}
@end deftypefn

@deftypefn Random {unsigned long int} gsl_rng_max (const gsl_rng * @var{r})
@code{gsl_rng_max} returns the maximum value that @code{gsl_rng_get}
can return.
@end deftypefn

@deftypefn Random {unsigned long int} gsl_rng_min (const gsl_rng * @var{r})
@code{gsl_rng_max} returns the minimum value that @code{gsl_rng_get}
can return. Usually this value is zero. There are some generators with
algorithms that cannot return zero, and for these generators the minimum
value is 1.
@end deftypefn

@node Random number environment variables
@section Random number environment variables

The library allows you to choose a default generator and seed from the
environment variables @code{GSL_RNG_TYPE} and @code{GSL_RNG_SEED} and
the function @code{gsl_rng_env_setup}. This makes it easy try out
different generators and seeds without having to recompile your program.

@deftypefun {const gsl_rng_type *} gsl_rng_env_setup (void)
This function reads the environment variables @code{GSL_RNG_TYPE} and
@code{GSL_RNG_SEED} and uses their values to set the corresponding
library variables @code{gsl_rng_default} and
@code{gsl_rng_default_seed} which are defined as follows,

@example
extern const gsl_rng_type *gsl_rng_default
extern unsigned long int gsl_rng_default_seed
@end example

The environment variable @code{GSL_RNG_TYPE} should be the name of a
generator, such as @code{taus} or @code{mt19937}. The environment
variable @code{GSL_RNG_SEED} should contain the desired seed value. It
is converted to an @code{unsigned long int} using the C library function
@code{strtoul}.

The initial default generator is @code{gsl_rng_cmrg} and the initial
value of @code{gsl_rng_default seed} is zero.
@end deftypefun
@noindent
Here is a short program which shows how to create a global
generator using the environment variables @code{GSL_RNG_TYPE} and
@code{GSL_RNG_SEED},

@example
#include <stdio.h>
#include <gsl_rng.h>

gsl_rng * r ;  /* global generator */

int 
main ()
@{
  gsl_rng_env_setup() ;

  r = gsl_rng_alloc (gsl_rng_default);
  
  printf("generator type: %s\n", gsl_rng_name (r));
  printf("seed = %u\n", gsl_rng_default_seed);
  printf("first value = %u\n", gsl_rng_get (r)) ;
@}
@end example
@noindent
Running the program without any environment variables
uses the initial defaults, a @code{cmrg} generator with
a seed of 0,
@example
bjg|zeke> ./a.out 
generator type: cmrg
seed = 0
first value = 240037626
@end example
@noindent
By setting the two variables on the command line we can
change the default generator and the seed,
@example
bjg|zeke> GSL_RNG_TYPE="taus" GSL_RNG_SEED=123 ./a.out 
GSL_RNG_TYPE=taus
GSL_RNG_SEED=123
generator type: taus
seed = 123
first value = 2720986350
@end example

@node Saving and restoring random number generator state
@section Saving and restoring random number generator state

The above methods ignore the random number `state' which changes from
call to call.  It is often useful to be able to save and restore the
state.  To permit these practices, a few somewhat more advanced
functions are supplied.  These include:

@deftypefn Random {gsl_rng *} gsl_rng_cpy (gsl_rng * @var{dest}, const gsl_rng * @var{src})
This function copies the random number generator @var{src} into the
pre-exisiting generator @var{dest}, making @var{dest} into an exact copy
of @var{src}. It returns @var{dest} if successful and a null pointer if
sufficient memory could not be allocated.
@end deftypefn

@deftypefn Random {gsl_rng *} gsl_rng_clone (const gsl_rng * @var{r})
This function returns a pointer to a newly created generator which is an
exact copy of the generator @var{r}.
@end deftypefn

@deftypefn Random void gsl_rng_print_state (const gsl_rng * @var{r})
This function prints a hex-dump of the state of the generator @var{r} to
stdout. At the moment its only use is for debugging.
@end deftypefn

@node Available random number generator algorithms
@section Available random number generator algorithms

The above functions make no reference to the actual algorithm used.
This is deliberate so that you can switch algorithms without having to
change any of your application source code. The library provides a
large number of generators of different types, including simulation
quality generators, generators provided for compatibility with other
libraries and historical generators from the past.

@subsection Simulation quality generators

The following generators are recommended for use in simulation. They
have extremely long periods and pass most statistical tests.

@deffn {Generator} gsl_rng_mt19937
@cindex MT19937 random number generator
The MT19937 generator of Makoto Matsumoto and Takuji Nishimura is based
on a variant of the twisted generalized feedback shift-register
generator, with a Mersenne prime period of @math{2^@{19937@} - 1} (about
@math{10^@{6000@}}). It is equi-distributed in 623 dimensions and has
passed the @sc{diehard} statistical tests. It uses 624 words of state
per generator and is comparable in speed to the other generators.

@deffn {Generator} gsl_rng_ranlux
@deffnx {Generator} gsl_rng_ranlux389
@cindex RANLUX random number generator
The @code{ranlux} generator uses the lagged-fibonacci-with-skipping
algorithm of Luscher to produce "luxury random numbers". It is a 24-bit
generator, originally designed for single-precision IEEE floating point
numbers. The period of the generator is about @math{10^@{171@}}. The
generator is slow, but the algorithm has been mathematically proven to
provide truly decorrelated numbers at a known level. The generator
@code{gsl_rng_ranlux} is the default level of decorrelation recommended
by Luscher and @code{gsl_rng_ranlux389} provides the highest level of
randomness, with all 24 bits decorrelated. Both types of generator use
24 words of state per generator.

@subsection Generators provided for compatibility
The generators in this section are provided for compatibility with
existing libraries. If you are converting an existing program to use GSL
then you can select these generators to check your new implementation
against the original one, using the same random number generator. After
verifying that your new program rerproduces the original results you can
then switch to a higher-quality generator.

The standard Unix random number generators @code{rand}, @code{random}
and @code{rand48} are provided as part of GSL. Although these generators
are widely available sometime they aren't all available on the same
platform in the system libraries. This makes it more difficult to write
portable code and so we have included them in GSL for convenience. Note
that these generators don't produce high-quality randomness and aren't
suitable for work requiring accurate statistics. However, if you won't
be measuring statistical quantities and just want to introduce some
variation into your program then these generators are quite acceptable.

@cindex BSD random number generator, rand
@cindex Unix random number generators, rand
@cindex Unix random number generators, rand48

@deffn {Generator} gsl_rng_rand

@noindent
with @math{a = 1103515245}, @math{c = 12345} and @math{m = 2^@{31@}}.

generator is @math{2^@{31@}}, and it uses 1 word of storage per
generator.

@deffn {Generator} gsl_rng_rand48
@cindex rand48 random number generator
This is the 48-bit Unix @code{rand48} generator. Its sequence is
@c
@equation
x_@{n+1@} = (a x_n + c) @mod m
@end equation
@noindent
defined on 48-bit unsigned integers with @math{a =25214903917}, @math{c
= 11} and @math{m = 2^@{48@}}. The seed specifies the upper 32 bits of
the initial value, @math{x_1}, with the lower 16 bits set to
@code{0x330E}. The function @code{gsl_rng_get} returns the upper 32 bits
from each term of the sequence. This does not have a direct parallel in
the original @code{rand48} functions, but forcing the result to type
@code{long int} reproduce the sequence of @code{mrand48}. The function
@code{gsl_rng_uniform} uses the full 48 bits of internal state to return
the double precision number @math{x_n/m}, which is equivalent to the
function @code{drand48}.
@end deffn

@cindex Random number generators, Numerical recipes
@cindex Numerical recipes, random number generators
The following generators are provided for compatibility with
@cite{Numerical Recipes}. Note that the original Numerical Recipes
functions used single precision while we use double precision. This will
lead to minor discrepancies, but only at the level of single-precision
rounding error. If necessary you can force the returned values to single
precision by storing them in a @code{volatile float}, which prevents the
value being held in a register with double or extended precision. Apart
from this difference the underlying algorithms for the integer part of
the generators are the same.

Numerical recipes @code{ran0} implements Park and Miller's @sc{minstd}
algorithm.

@end deffn

The following generator is provided for compatibility with the CRAY
MATHLIB routine RANF. It produces double precision floating point
numbers which should be identical to those from the original RANF.

@deffn {Generator} gsl_rng_ranf
@cindex RANF random number generator
@cindex CRAY random number generator, RANF
This is the CRAY random number generator @code{RANF}. Its
sequence is
@c
@equation
x_@{n+1@} = (a x_n) @mod m
@end equation
@noindent
defined on 48-bit unsigned integers with @math{a = 44485709377909} and
@math{m = 2^@{48@}}.  The seed specifies the lower 32 bits of the
initial value, @math{x_1}, with the lowest bit set to prevent the seed
taking an even value.  The upper 16 bits of @math{x_1} are set to 0. A
consequence of this procedure is that the pairs of seeds 2 and 3, 4 and
5, etc produce the same sequences.

There is a subtlety in the implementation of the seeding. The initial
state is reversed through one step, by multiplying by the modular
inverse of @math{a} mod @math{m}. This is done for compatibility with
the original CRAY implementation.

Note that you can only seed the generator with integers up to
@math{2^@{32@}}, while the original CRAY implementation uses
non-portable wide integers which can cover all @math{2^@{48@}} states of
the generator.

The function @code{gsl_rng_get} returns the upper 32 bits from each term
of the sequence.  The function @code{gsl_rng_uniform} uses the full 48
bits to return the double precision number @math{x_n/m}.

The period of this generator is @math{2^@{46@}}.

The following generators are included only for historical reasons, so
that you can reproduce results from old programs which might have used
them. These generators should not be used for real simulations since
they have poor statistical properties by modern standards.

@section Random Number Distributions
@cindex random number distributions

Distributions of random numbers can be obtained from any of the
generators using the following transformation functions. In the simplest
cases a non-uniform distribution can be obtained analytically from the
uniform distribution. This uses one call to the random number
generator. More complicated distributions are created by the
@dfn{acceptance-rejection} method which often requires multiple samples
from the generator.

@deftypefn Random double gsl_ran_gaussian (const gsl_rng * @var{r})
@cindex Gaussian random numbers
@code{gsl_ran_gaussian} returns a gaussian random number, with mean zero
and variance one. The probability distribution for gaussian random
numbers is,
@c
@equation
p(x) dx = @{1 \over \sqrt@{2 \pi@}@} \exp (-x^2/2) dx
@end equation
@noindent
for @math{x} in the range @math{-\infty} to @math{+\infty}.
@end deftypefn

@deftypefn Random int gsl_ran_poisson (const gsl_rng * @var{r}, double @var{mu})
@cindex Poisson random numbers
@code{gsl_ran_poisson} returns a poisson--distributed random integer,
with mean @var{mu}. The probability distribution for poisson random
numbers is,
@c
@equation
p(n) = @{\mu^n \over n!@} \exp(-\mu)
@end equation
@noindent
for @math{n \ge 0}.
@end deftypefn

@deftypefn Random void gsl_ran_poisson_array (const gsl_rng * @var{r}, double @var{mu}, int @var{N}, int *@var{p})
@code{gsl_ran_poisson_array} places an array of @var{N}
poisson--distributed random numbers with mean @var{mu} into the array
@var{p}.
@end deftypefn

@deftypefn Random double gsl_ran_exponential (const gsl_rng * @var{r}, double @var{mu})
@cindex Exponential random numbers
@code{gsl_ran_exponential} returns a exponential--distributed random
number, with mean @var{mu}.  
@c
@equation
p(x) dx = @{1 \over \mu@} \exp(-x/\mu) dx
@end equation
@noindent
for @math{x \ge 0}.

This is calculated with @math{-mu*log(x)}.
@end deftypefn

@deftypefn Random int gsl_ran_gamma (const gsl_rng * @var{r}, double @var{a})
@cindex Gamma distribution random numbers
@code{gsl_ran_gamma} returns a gamma-distributed random number.  The
distribution function is
@c
@equation
F(x) = @{ @{1@} \over @{ \Gamma(a)@} \int_0^x t^@{a-1@} e^@{-t@} dt @}
@end equation
@end deftypefn

@deftypefn Random {int *} gsl_ran_shuffle (int N, int *x)
@code{gsl_ran_shuffle} takes an array of N integers x[0..N-1] and 
randomly shuffles their order.  @code{x} is altered and is returned.
if @code{x} is supplied as NULL, then memory is allocated for
@code{x[]}, and it is filled with a random permutation of the 
numbers 0,...,N-1.  
@end deftypefn

@deftypefn Random {int *} gsl_ran_choose (int K, int N, int *x)
@code{gsl_ran_choose} fills the array @code{x[K]} with @code{K}
integers taken randomly from 0,...,N-1.  It is required that 
@code{K} be less than or equal to @code{N}. The numbers will be
in numerical order.  You will need to call @code{gsl_ran_shuffle(K,x)}
if you want them in random order.
