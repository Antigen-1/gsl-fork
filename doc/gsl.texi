@cindex numerical analysis
@cindex free software

There is a need for scientists and engineers to have a numerical
analysis library that:
@itemize @bullet
@item
is free (in the sense of freedom, not in the sense of gratis; see the
GNU General Public License), so that people can use that library,
redistribute it, modify it @dots{}
@item
is written in C using modern coding conventions, calling conventions,
scoping @dots{}
@item
is clearly and pedagogically documented; preferably with TeXinfo, so as
to allow online info, WWW and TeX output.
@item
uses top quality state-of-the-art algorithms.
@item
is portable and configurable using @emph{autoconf} and @emph{automake}.
@item
basically, is GNUlitically correct.
@item
whatever...
@end itemize

There are strengths and weaknesses with existing libraries:

@emph{Netlib} [FIXME: ref] is probably the most advanced set of
numerical algorithms available on the net, maintained by AT&T.
Unfortunately the software is written in Fortran, with strange calling
conventions in many places.  It is also not very well collected, so it
is a lot of work to get started with netlib.

@emph{Numerical Recipies} [FIXME: ref] is an excellent book: it explains
the algorithms in a very clear way.  Unfortunately the authors released
the source code under a bizarre license which allows you to use it, but
makes you nervous about re-distributing it.  Thus Numerical Recipes is
not @emph{free} in the sense of @emph{freedom}.  On top of that, the
implementation suffers from @emph{fortranitis} and other
limitations. [FIXME give refs on review of NR]

@section Language for implementation

Issues:

@strong{One language only (C)}

Advantages: simpler, compiler available and quite universal.

Disadvantages: excludes large body of old fortran code.  (Is that really
a disadvantage?)

@strong{More than one language}

Must be parsed by gcc (C++, objective C, fortran 77).

Routines must be trivially callable by C, without having to write
wrappers.

@strong{If we do it in C}

How do we protect name space, and keep global vars from being annoying?
Make recommendations to implementors to help with these issues.


@node Interface to other languages, What routines are implemented, Language for implementation, Design
@section Interface to other languages

We should propose a format for writing wrappers for other languages.

Wrapper packages are supplied as "extra" packages; not as part of the
"core".

The wrapper packages can be organized either @emph{by language} or
@emph{by numerical subsystem}.

What languages should be supported?
@itemize @bullet
@item
C++ (pay much attention to the design)
@item
scheme/guile
@item
sather
@item
IDL
@item
whatever
@end itemize




@node What routines are implemented, Standards and conventions, Interface to other languages, Design
@section What routines are implemented


For more guidance we might look at the Forth Scientific Library [see the
URL http://www.taygeta.com/fsl/sciforth.html].

interesting distributions.

@node Standards and conventions, Legal issues, What routines are implemented, Design
@section Standards and conventions

The people who kick off this project should set the coding standards and
conventions.  Some things that should be set are:

@itemize @bullet
@item
Function arguments
@item
Sub-package function name prefixes
@item
Documentation: the project leaders should give examples of how things
are to be documented.  High quality documentation is absolutely
mandatory, so documentation should introduce the topic, and give careful
reference for the provided functions.

@end itemize




@node Legal issues, Non-UNIX portability, Standards and conventions, Design
@section Legal issues

@itemize @bullet
@item
Each contributor must make sure her code is under the GNU General Public
License (GPL).
@item
We must understand ownership of existing code and algorithms.
@itemize @minus
@item
Obviously: don't reference non-free code (such as numerical recipes).
@item
I @strong{think} one can reference algorithms from classic books on
numerical analysis.
@end itemize

@end itemize




@node Non-UNIX portability, Compatibility with other libraries, Legal issues, Design
@section Non-UNIX portability

There is good reason to make this library work on non-UNIX systems.  It
is probably safe to ignore DOS and only worry about windows95/windowsNT
portability (so filenames can be long, I think).

On the other hand, nobody should be forced to use non-UNIX systems for
development.

The best solution is probably to issue guidelines for portability, like
saying "don't use XYZ unless you absolutely have to".  Then the Windows
people will be able to do their porting.

We should also read up on what Cygnus is doing for their win32
portability.



@node Compatibility with other libraries, Parallelism, Non-UNIX portability, Design
@section Compatibility with other libraries


Other libraries, such as Netlib and Numerical Recipes, are widely used.
It would be good to allow drop-in replacement of these libraries, as
long as that does not compromise the quality of our routines.

Compatibility should be provided by a set of wrappers, shipped as an
auxiliary package.

There are probably no legal issues on this front.





@node Parallelism,  , Compatibility with other libraries, Design
@section Parallelism

An extra sub-package with parallel libraries would be nice.  These
should use standard libraries such as PVM or MPI.  (It appears that PVM
ships with MPI, and vice-versa; we should figure out which is the
recommended platform.)

@deftp {Simulated annealing} Union Element
Element is a union.  Each field in the union describes one of the
possible spaces through which the simulated annealing package can
search.

Users should add more types to the union Element; here's the definition
of @var{Element} I ship (allows @math{R^1}, @math{R^2}, @math{R^3}
and cellular automata spaces):
@smallexample
union u_Element @{
  double D1;

Does a @emph{simulated annealing} search through a given space (defined
