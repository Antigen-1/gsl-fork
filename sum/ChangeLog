	* levin_u.c levin_uerr.c: changed DBL_MAX to GSL_DBL_MAX since we
 	don't rely on DBL_MAX

Sat Feb  6 20:35:26 1999  Brian Gough  <bjg@netsci.freeserve.co.uk>

	* test.c: adjusted the precision check to allow for "infinite
 	accuracy" which occurs when two results agree to machine precision

Thu Nov 19 13:10:19 1998  Brian Gough  <bjg@vvv.lanl.gov>

	* added an n_used parameter to all routines which gives the number
 	of terms actually used

Tue Nov 17 12:31:03 1998  Brian Gough  <bjg@vvv.lanl.gov>

	* test.c: added #include <config.h>

	* renamed test_sum.c to test.c

	* renamed all the functions so that _with_derivs is now the
 	default and _trunc is the case of no error estimates from the
 	derivatives

	* test_sum.c (main): cleaned up tests

Mon Nov  9 22:05:45 1998  Brian Gough  <bjg@vvv.lanl.gov>

	* levin_u.c (gsl_sum_levin_u_accel_minmax): got rid of noise
 	variables since they aren't used in the non-derivative case

1998-11-06    <bjg@ancho.lanl.gov>

	* test_sum.c: replace variable N by macro to avoid variable length
	array warning

Tue Oct 27 18:06:16 1998  Brian Gough  <bjg@vvv.lanl.gov>

	* levin_u.c: added in noise but it does not seem to be giving the
 	right answer for the error estimate. The actual value for the
 	accelerated sum is correct though. Check toms/602 for the original
 	algorithm.
