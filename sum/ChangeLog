	* levin_u.c (gsl_sum_levin_u_accel_minmax): got rid of noise
 	variables since they aren't used in the non-derivative case

	* test_sum.c: replace variable N by macro to avoid variable length
	array warning

	* levin_u.c: added in noise but it does not seem to be giving the
 	right answer for the error estimate. The actual value for the
 	accelerated sum is correct though. Check toms/602 for the original
 	algorithm.
