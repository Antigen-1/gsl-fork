* Upgrade to texinfo-4.0.  

* Definitions of macros which are negative numbers should use
parentheses, e.g. in gsl_machine.h we need #define GSL_LOG_DBL_EPSILON
(-3.6043653389117154e+01) instead of -3.604...

* Fix texinfo files so that sentences consistently use a double space
after the preceding period (n.b. do this by hand, because there are
names in the references which need only a single space,
e.g. D. E. Knuth).

* In matrix struct change dim2 to tda, otherwise the distinction of
size2 vs dim2 is totally confusing.

* Should doc/mdate-sh be in CVS? Automake needs it unless you supply --missing

No. The automake command in autogen.sh has --missing.
