This file documents problems installing GSL on specific platforms.

IRIX
----

The 32 bit IRIX compiler gives warnings about "long double" not being
supported. These can be ignored or turned off with,

   CCFLAGS="-woff 728" ./configure

or 

   make CCFLAGS="-woff 728"

The compiler also gives warnings about certain libraries that are "not
used for resolving any symbol". This is harmless and the warnings can
be ignored.


DOS
---

When using DJGPP The default stack size of 512k is insufficient for
the specfunc tests and will cause them to crash.  To increase the
stack size by a suitable amount use,

  	stubedit test.exe minstack=1536k

on the executable and then rerun it manually.
