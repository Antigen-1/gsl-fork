This file documents problems installing GSL on specific platforms.

Digital Unix
------------

Problems have been reported with the "fixed" float.h header file
installed with gcc-2.95. It lacks some of the definitions in the
system float.h. The symptoms are errors like: 

  `FP_RND_RN' undeclared

To work around this it may be necessary to include the system float.h
in ieee-utils/fp-tru64.c before the gcc version, e.g.

  #include "/usr/include/float.h"
  #include <float.h>
 

IRIX
----

The 32 bit IRIX compiler gives warnings about "long double" not being
supported. These can be ignored or turned off with,

   CCFLAGS="-woff 728" ./configure

or 

   make CCFLAGS="-woff 728"

The compiler also gives warnings about certain libraries that are "not
used for resolving any symbol". This is harmless and the warnings can
be ignored.
