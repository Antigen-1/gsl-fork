This file documents problems installing GSL on specific platforms.

All
---

Attempts to run 'strip' on the static library libgsl.a may produce a
broken library (it is known to happen with GNU binutils strip, and
probably affects others too). The libgsl.a ar archive made by libtool
contains files with the same filenames from different directories, and
this causes the strip program to overwrite these archive entries.  If
you need to produce a compact version of the library compile without
-g instead of using strip.

IRIX
----

The 32 bit IRIX compiler gives warnings about "long double" not being
supported. These can be ignored or turned off with,

   CCFLAGS="-woff 728" ./configure

or 

   make CCFLAGS="-woff 728"

The compiler also gives warnings about certain libraries that are "not
used for resolving any symbol". This is harmless and the warnings can
be ignored.


DOS
---

When using DJGPP The default stack size of 512k is insufficient for
the specfunc tests and will cause them to crash.  To increase the
stack size by a suitable amount use,

  	stubedit test.exe minstack=1536k

on the executable and then rerun it manually.
