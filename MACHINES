Digital Unix

Problem have been reported with the "fixed" float.h installed with
gcc-2.95 lacking some of the definitions in the system float.h (the
symptoms are errors like: `FP_RND_RN' undeclared). To work around this
it may be necessary to include the system float.h in
ieee-utils/fp-tru64.c before the gcc version, e.g.

  #include "/usr/include/float.h"
  #include <float.h>
