This file documents problems installing GSL on specific platforms.

Digital Unix
------------

Problems have been reported with the "fixed" float.h header file
installed with gcc-2.95. It lacks some of the definitions in the
system float.h. The symptoms are errors like: 

  `FP_RND_RN' undeclared

To work around this it may be necessary to include the system float.h
in ieee-utils/fp-tru64.c before the gcc version, e.g.

  #include "/usr/include/float.h"
  #include <float.h>
