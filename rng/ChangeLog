	* removed the gsl- prefix from generator name strings

	* test.c: added a 10000 iteration check for cmrg

	* got rid of init_state values. It's simpler to generate them
 	directly from the seed, the cost of creating an rng is not usually
 	a big deal.
	
	* rng.c: eliminated the gsl_rng_internal struct since it was not
 	really necessary

	* minstd.c: added Park and Millers MINSTD generator

Thu Jun 11 18:08:40 1998  Brian Gough  <bjg@vvv.lanl.gov>

	* this will be an alternate, thread-safe interface to the random
 	number generators.
