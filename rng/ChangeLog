Sat Jul  4 11:14:49 1998  Brian Gough  <bjg@vvv.lanl.gov>

	* ranmar.c: added the RANMAR generator

	* tds.c: added the INMOS Transputer RNG

	* test.c (rng_min_test): added a test for RAND_MIN, to make sure
 	none of the generators go below it. Statistically the test is not
 	much good since it's very unlikely that an off-by-one error would
 	show up unless we ran the test for > 4 billion numbers. However,
 	the test might detect a gross error like a typo in RAND_MIN or a
 	degeneracy 0,0,0,... for a multiplicative generator.

	* uni.c: fixed RAND_MAX here too

	* uni32.c: fixed RAND_MAX to m1-1, not m1 (since it's modulo m1 so
 	m1 can't occur, only m1-1)

Fri Jul  3 15:55:34 1998  Brian Gough  <bjg@vvv.lanl.gov>

	* rng.c (gsl_rng_uniform_gt0_lt1): added a function which returns
 	numbers in the range (0,1), i.e. excluding 0.0 and 1.0

	* renamed bad_randu.c to randu.c

	* renamed bad_rand.c to bsdrand.c

Mon Jun 29 18:11:08 1998  Brian Gough  <bjg@vvv.lanl.gov>

	* added implementations of the numerical recipes algorithms ran0,
 	ran1, ran2, ran3
	
Sun Jun 28 11:51:48 1998  Brian Gough  <bjg@vvv.lanl.gov>

	* gsl_rng.h: added gsl_rng_uniform_pos which guarantees positive
 	numbers, (0,1]

	* added a RAND_MIN entry to the gsl_rng/gsl_rng_type structs

	* gsl_rng.h: renamed gsl_rng_get_uni to gsl_rng_uniform

Wed Jun 24 12:10:23 1998  Brian Gough  <bjg@vvv.lanl.gov>

	* gsl_rng.h: added inline versions of gsl_rng_get and
 	gsl_rng_get_uni

	* benchmark.c: added a simple benchmark program to measure rng's
 	per second

	* test.c (N2): reduced the number of tests from 1 million to 100k
 	to speed things up a bit

	* changed the generic seeding algorithm to s -> (69069*s) &
 	0xFFFFFFFF which covers all 32 bits.

Sun Jun 21 23:24:36 1998  Brian Gough  <bjg@vvv.lanl.gov>

	* added the MT19937 and TT880 mersenne prime generators

Sat Jun 20 13:58:40 1998  Brian Gough  <bjg@vvv.lanl.gov>

	* ensured that 32 bit quantities are defined as 'long', as
 	required by ANSI. On a 16 bit platform 'int' is usually just 16
 	bits.
	
	* ranlux.c: added the RANLUX generator

Fri Jun 19 11:12:06 1998  Brian Gough  <bjg@vvv.lanl.gov>

	* removed the gsl- prefix from generator name strings

Thu Jun 18 12:17:16 1998  Brian Gough  <bjg@vvv.lanl.gov>

	* test.c: added a 10000 iteration check for cmrg

	* got rid of init_state values. It's simpler to generate them
 	directly from the seed, the cost of creating an rng is not usually
 	a big deal.
	
	* rng.c: eliminated the gsl_rng_internal struct since it was not
 	really necessary

Wed Jun 17 17:31:27 1998  Brian Gough  <bjg@vvv.lanl.gov>

	* minstd.c: added Park and Millers MINSTD generator

Thu Jun 11 18:08:40 1998  Brian Gough  <bjg@vvv.lanl.gov>

	* this will be an alternate, thread-safe interface to the random
 	number generators.
