1. Improve the seeding for routines that use the LCG seed generator.
It can only generate 130,000 different initial states. We should
change it to provide 2^31 different initial states (this will also
prevent the high bits being zero).

2. Make things work on 64 bit platforms. Sometimes we just need to use
& 0xffffffff on 32 bit quantities that are returned to the user where
we rely on 32 bit arithmetic, sometimes it is more complicated
(e.g. the Tausworthe generator relies on 32 bit arithmetic at all
stages).
