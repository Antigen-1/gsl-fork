	* added a stream handler, for the error stream

	* completely reorganized the files, but the functions are
 	relatively unchanged

Wed Apr  8 13:55:48 1998  Brian Gough  <bjg@vvv.lanl.gov>

	* gsl_errno.h (GSL_ERROR_RETURN_NOTHING): added an error macro
 	suitable for void functions

Mon Apr  6 14:10:48 1998  Brian Gough  <bjg@vvv.lanl.gov>

	* gsl_errno.h: use enum instead of #define for symbolic constants,
 	so that they can be seen in the debugger

Sun Apr  5 19:49:17 1998  Brian Gough  <bjg@vvv.lanl.gov>

	* err/errno.c (gsl_error): now takes gsl_errno as an argument
 	(this is useful for doing conditional breakpoints)
