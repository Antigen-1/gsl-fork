	* test_source.c: added tests for gsl_vector_ptr with and without

	* gsl_vector_char.h: added missing code to gsl_vector_char_ptr for
 	stride in char case.
	

Sun Nov  8 18:39:40 1998  Brian Gough  <bjg@vvv.lanl.gov>

	* test_io.c, test_complex_io.c: split out the printf/scanf

	* added support for complex vectors

Mon Apr  6 15:06:38 1998  Brian Gough  <bjg@vvv.lanl.gov>

	* make range checking the default, you have to define
