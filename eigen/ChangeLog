	* unified error handling conventions to _e for error handling
 	functions and no suffix for plain functions, so _impl functions
 	are no longer needed.

	* removed tests for EFAULT, since EFAULT should only apply to
 	invalid non-null pointers.

	* eigen/test.c (test_invert_jacobi): removed matmult and replaced
 	by gsl_blas_dgemm
