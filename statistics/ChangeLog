	* Added a new recurrence algorithm for the mean, variance, skew
 	and kurtosis. It uses a running value which is less likely to
 	overflow than a global sum.

	* completely reorganised the source system to use macros as
	a primitive form of templates.

	* make everything const where possible (to reduce the chance of errors)

	* skew.c: compute the skewness of a dataset

	* percentiles.c: find a given percentile from a sorted dataset

	* minmax.c: allow the user to find the indices of the max/min
 	data points, in addition to the max/min values

	* median.c: compute the median of a sorted dataset

	* kurtosis.c: compute the kurtosis

	* absdev.c: compute absolute deviations

	* split statistics functions into double versions (gsl_stats) and
 	integer versions (gsl_stats_int). There is a script
 	(convert_double_to_int.pl) to make the integer versions from the
 	double versions.
