This is GSL, the GNU Scientific Library.

It is still in early stages of development, but it is being placed on
ftp://alpha.gnu.org/gnu/ in hopes that others might be interested in
joining the project.

See the NEWS file for recent developments.

A test suite is available for most of the libraries.  It can be
invoked with "make check" in each directory.  All tests can be run
together with "make check" at the top level.

GNU Libtool is used to build shared libraries. Compilation of shared
libraries can be turned off by specifying the `--disable-shared'
option to `configure'.

If you run "make check" and get some failures, please see the
KNOWN-PROBLEMS file.  This file lists failures we already know about.
If you get failures that are not mentioned in the KNOWN-PROBLEMS file,
please report them. 

For installation problems on specific platforms see the MACHINES file.

Until we have set up a separate bug reporting address, please report
bugs to the GSL discussion list gsl-discuss@sources.redhat.com

If you are interested in participating in GSL development, please send
mail to Mark Galassi -- rosalia@lanl.gov
