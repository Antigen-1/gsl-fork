GSL - GNU Scientific Library
============================

This is GSL, the GNU Scientific Library, a collection of numerical
routines for scientific computing.

GSL is free software, you can redistribute it and/or modify it under
the terms of the GNU General Public License.

The GNU General Public License does not permit this software to be
redistributed in proprietary programs.

This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but
WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Availability
============

The current stable version of GSL is always available from ftp.gnu.org
in the directory /pub/gnu.

A list of mirror sites can be found at http://www.gnu.org/order/ftp.html

Installation
============

To compile GSL you will need an ANSI C-compiler.  After unpacking the
distribution the Makefiles can be prepared using the configure
command,

  ./configure

You can then build the library by typing,

  make

By default both static and shared versions of the libraries are
compiled.  Compilation of shared libraries can be turned off by
specifying the `--disable-shared' option to `configure', e.g.
  
  ./configure --disable-shared

This is recommended if you encounter problems building the library,
because some platforms do not support shared libraries.

For notes about problems with specific platforms and compilers see the
MACHINES file.

An extensive test suite is available.  It can be invoked with "make
check" in each directory.  All tests can be run together with "make
check" at the top level.  The test output should be directed to a file
rather than a terminal, with the command,

   make check > log 2>&1

since it is several megabytes in size.

If you run "make check" and get some failures, please see the MACHINES
file. If you find failures that are not mentioned, please report them.

The library can be installed using the command,

  make install

The default install directory prefix is /usr/local.  Consult the file
INSTALL for information on installing the library in another location
or changing other default compilation options.
