This is GSL, the GNU Scientific Library.

It is in the final stages of development, and is being made available
in hopes that others might be interested in joining the project and
debugging the code.

See the NEWS file for recent developments.

The project hompage is http://sources.redhat.com/gsl/

A test suite is available for most of the libraries.  It can be
invoked with "make check" in each directory.  All tests can be run
together with "make check" at the top level.

GNU Libtool is used to build shared libraries.  Compilation of shared
libraries can be turned off by specifying the `--disable-shared'
option to `configure', e.g.
  
  ./configure --disable-shared

This is recommended if you encounter problems building the library.

If you run "make check" and get some failures, please see the
KNOWN-PROBLEMS file.  This file lists failures we already know about.
If you get failures that are not mentioned in the KNOWN-PROBLEMS file,
please report them. 

For installation problems on specific platforms see the MACHINES file.

Until we have set up a separate bug reporting address, please report
bugs to the GSL discussion list gsl-discuss@sources.redhat.com

If you are interested in participating in GSL development, please send
mail to Mark Galassi -- rosalia@lanl.gov
