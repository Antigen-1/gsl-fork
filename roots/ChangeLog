	* roots.h: got rid of local MAX(a,b) and MIN(a,b) definitions
 	since they are now in config.h

	* test.c (test_brent): allow the brent tests to run for more
 	iterations since they take longer on the pathological cases.

	* brent.c (gsl_root_brent): on each iteration keep track of
 	current best estimates of the root and the bounds so that they are
 	returned to the user if the function exits prematurely.

	clean up the brent algorithm based on remarks in the original
 	paper

	* in all routines with upper and lower bounds if a root is found
 	exactly then the bracket is collapsed onto the root instead of
 	being untouched.

Thu Oct 15 13:59:30 1998  Brian Gough  <bjg@vvv.lanl.gov>

	* bisection.c, falsepos.c, secant.c: reordered the tests so that
 	the minimum number of function evaluations are performed when
 	there is an early exit due to one of the supplied limits lying on
 	a root.

Fri Aug 21 14:48:13 1998  Brian Gough  <bjg@vvv.lanl.gov>

	* test.c: clean up of tests to get rid of warnings

Thu Aug 20 10:21:15 1998  Brian Gough  <bjg@vvv.lanl.gov>

	* roots.h (_WITHIN_TOL): added extra parens in macro definition,
 	for safety

	* falsepos.c (gsl_root_falsepos): removed test for absolute
 	equality and replaced by a flag indicating which variables
 	changed.

	* test.c (main): simplified the tests, removed command line
 	arguments (can use the debugger to select which ones to run)

Mon Jun 15 22:22:54 1998  Brian Gough  <bjg@vvv.lanl.gov>

	* started to eliminate void * arguments for function types (they
 	are not a good idea and can easily be specified)

1998-02-09  Mark Galassi  <rosalia@cygnus.com>

	* test.c (main): added an extra argument so that the $(srcdir) can
	be passed along when "make check" is run in a separate build
	directory.

	* test-macros, test-secant, test-bisection, test-newton,
	test-falsepos: modified these to use build and source directories
	explicitly.  Now "make check" in a separate build directory works.

1998-02-02  Mark Galassi  <rosalia@cygnus.com>

	* Makefile.am (TESTS): added $(srcdir) before these scripts, since
	the TESTS target picks things from the build directory.
