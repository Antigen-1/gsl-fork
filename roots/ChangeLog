	* test.c (main): added an extra argument so that the $(srcdir) can
	be passed along when "make check" is run in a separate build
	directory.

	* test-macros, test-secant, test-bisection, test-newton,
	test-falsepos: modified these to use build and source directories
	explicitly.  Now "make check" in a separate build directory works.

	* Makefile.am (TESTS): added $(srcdir) before these scripts, since
	the TESTS target picks things from the build directory.
