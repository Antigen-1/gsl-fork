* Surely this has been fixed now????

    FIXME: there is a problem with BRENT. The interval sometimes skips off
    the root.  Somewhere the best guess is being used as the interval
    endpoint which is wrong.

* Add an inline version of the iterate method for speed? Perhaps not,
the time taken for each iteration surely dominated by the convergence
test.

* Numerical derivatives? Maybe have a function to manufacture an fdf
from an f and optionally a df. (We'll need to approximate the
derivative if it is not provided; this is something which should be
done outside the root finding package.)
