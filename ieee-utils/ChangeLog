	* fp-unknown.c (gsl_ieee_set_mode): made return type int, as it
 	should be

Mon Jun 15 22:02:00 1998  Brian Gough  <bjg@vvv.lanl.gov>

	* renamed read-mode-string.c to read.c and print-ieee.c to print.c

Tue Jun  2 19:29:34 1998  Brian Gough  <bjg@vvv.lanl.gov>

	* gsl_ieee_utils.h: renamed GSL_IEEE_CATCH_INEXACT to
 	GSL_IEEE_TRAP_INEXACT, which is a better name

Mon Jun  1 15:27:08 1998  Brian Gough  <bjg@vvv.lanl.gov>

	* fp-sunos4.c: support for sunos4 IEEE interface

	* fp-solaris.c: support for solaris IEEE interface

	* renamed fp-mode-string.c to fp-env.c, in order to avoid short
 	filename problems

	* added support for setting the IEEE mode from the environment
	variable GSL_IEEE_MODE (only works for the Linux kernel so far)

	* The determination of endianness is now done on each call instead
 	of at configure time (autoconf complains about what would happen
 	to the test if it were cross compiling). Ok, so it's a bit slower
	but this isn't a performance critical routine.

	* This directory contains some routines for examining IEEE format
 	numbers at the bit level
