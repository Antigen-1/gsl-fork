	* math.c: changed calls to gsl_hypot() to hypot() so that the
 	system function is used in preference (the configure script will
 	define hypot to gsl_hypot if hypot is unavailable), similar change
 	for functions log1p and gsl_log1p also

	* gsl_complex.h: moved into complex/ subdirectory from top-level
