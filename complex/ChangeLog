	* gsl_complex.h (GSL_COMPLEX_P): added macro to point to beginning
 	of complex array within the struct

Mon Dec  4 12:29:12 2000  Brian Gough  <bjg@network-theory.co.uk>

	* math.c (gsl_complex_rect): changed the function gsl_complex_xy
 	to gsl_complex_rect, since this is more meaningful

Sun Oct 22 13:55:09 2000  Brian Gough  <bjg@network-theory.co.uk>

	* math.c: changed calls to gsl_hypot() to hypot() so that the
 	system function is used in preference (the configure script will
 	define hypot to gsl_hypot if hypot is unavailable), similar change
 	for functions log1p and gsl_log1p also

	* gsl_complex.h: moved into complex/ subdirectory from top-level
