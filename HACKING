The GSL hacker needs some stuff that the end users don't:

* you must have the latest automake (1.1l or greater) from
ftp://ftp.cygnus.com/pub/tromey/

* you must have the latest autoconf from
ftp://prep.ai.mit.edu/u2/emacs/ (notice the studly use of the old
/u2/emacs path!)

* you must have the latest texinfo with Brian's mathematical hacks;
you can get that from /u/bjg/texinfo-3.9-math.tar.gz on the NIS
division computers.

* you must have the latest CVS (1.9 right now) from
ftp://prep.ai.mit.edu/u2/emacs/

Once you have this stuff, you can get the repository and start
working from your own machine.  To do the initial checkout of the
repository try (bash syntax):

export CVS_RSH=ssh
cvs -d your-login@sarastro.lanl.gov:/n/projects/cvs/ checkout gsl

at this point you can "cd gsl" and start mucking around with
"./configure --prefix=whatever; make install".  Once you are in the
gsl directory, future CVS commands will not need the -d option, so you
can just do

cvs update		(to make sure you get other people's new stuff)
cvs commit		(to check in your changes)
cvs add filename	(to add a file to the repository)

---------

Let me know if any of these steps don't work.  I have tried them out
on swift and they seem to work.

I also think you need something like

export CVSMASK=0

but I'm not sure offhand.

To check for ansi compliance try, 'make strict'. This compiles with the
following CFLAGS:

    -ansi -pedantic -W -Wall -Wtraditional -Wconversion -Wshadow
    -Wpointer-arith -Wcast-qual -Wcast-align -Wwrite-strings
    -Waggregate-return -Wstrict-prototypes -fshort-enums -fno-common
    -Wmissing-prototypes -Wnested-externs -Werror -g -O4
