	* Makefile.am (libgslpoly_a_SOURCES): for now commented out
	zsolve.c, since it has some strange errors that make it look like
	it was not committed.

Tue Aug 17 14:23:47 1999  Brian Gough  <bjg@network-theory.co.uk>

	* zsolve_cubic.c (gsl_poly_complex_solve_cubic): compute the
 	discriminant without division so that it is exact for exact inputs

	* solve_cubic.c (gsl_poly_solve_cubic): compute the discriminant
 	without division so that it is exact for exact inputs

	* changed the way roots are counted to make all the routines
 	consistent. Conincident roots are no longer a special case, now
 	they are made up of separate roots which happen to have the same
 	values.

	* zsolve_quadratic.c (gsl_poly_complex_solve_quadratic): in the
 	case of a multiple root set all the returned values r0 = r1 =
 	root, rather than just setting one and leaving the others
 	potentially unset.

	* solve_quadratic.c (gsl_poly_solve_quadratic):  ditto

Tue Aug  3 19:36:26 1999  Brian Gough  <bjg@network-theory.co.uk>

	* gsl_poly.h: changed all functions to take separate variables for
 	roots (z0, z1, z2) of variable-length arrays

	* split out polynomial root finding algorithms into a new poly/
 	directory
