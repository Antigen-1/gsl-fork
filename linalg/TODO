* Support M<N for SVD

* Provide support for the following special systems: 

   Vandermonde, Toeplitz, ...

* Sparse systems and BLAS 

   TAUCS is a C library of sparse linear solvers.

* pcholesky_decomp destroys upper half of matrix, which is
bad for pcholesky_rcond which needs original matrix to compute
||A||_1 - use additional workspace for row/col swap in _decomp
instead of using upper part of matrix?
