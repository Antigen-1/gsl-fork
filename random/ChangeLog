	* xxx-switch.xc: eliminated the need for string.h and strdup() by
 	making the generator names into const strings (it probably would
 	have been undesirable to allow the user to modify them anyway).

	* Makefile.am (libgslrandom_a_SOURCES): added gauss.o, poisson.o
	and exponential.o so that the basic distributions are available.
