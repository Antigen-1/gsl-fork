	* get2d.c (gsl_histogram2d_get): removed unnecessary reference to
 	find2d

Mon Jan 22 13:55:13 2001  Brian Gough  <bjg@network-theory.co.uk>

	* find.c (find): optimize for the linear case, include own binary
 	search for speed

	* add.c (gsl_histogram_accumulate): fix check of array bound for
 	index

Sun May 28 12:23:46 2000  Brian Gough  <bjg@network-theory.co.uk>

	* test2d.c (main): use binary mode "b" when reading and writing
 	binary files

	* test.c (main): use binary mode "b" when reading and writing
 	binary files

Wed Apr 26 15:09:22 2000  Brian Gough  <bjg@network-theory.co.uk>

	* oper2d.c (gsl_histogram2d_shift): added function for shifting
 	histogram by a constant offset

	* oper.c (gsl_histogram_shift): added function for shifting
 	histogram by a constant offset

Wed Apr 19 17:27:44 2000  Brian Gough  <bjg@network-theory.co.uk>

	* added numerous extensions from Simone Piccardi

2000-04-01  Mark Galassi  <rosalia@lanl.gov>

	* *.c: changed 0 -> GSL_SUCCESS where appropriate; THANKS to Dave
	Morrison.

Fri Nov 19 15:31:51 1999  Brian Gough  <bjg@network-theory.co.uk>

	* gsl-histogram.c (main): free memory before exit, eliminates
 	warning from checkergcc

	* test_gsl_histogram.sh: added a test for the gsl-histogram
 	program

Fri Oct  1 15:47:01 1999  Brian Gough  <bjg@network-theory.co.uk>

	* file.c file2d.c: converted to use new block i/o functions

Wed Aug 18 11:41:40 1999  Brian Gough  <bjg@network-theory.co.uk>

	* eliminated obvious memory leaks from the tests, so that we can
 	check that the _free functions work correctly

	* gsl-histogram.c (main): removed unused variable

Fri Aug  6 11:19:37 1999  Brian Gough  <bjg@network-theory.co.uk>

	* removed dependence on rand() and RAND_MAX

1999-08-05  Mark Galassi  <rosalia@lanl.gov>

	* gsl-histogram.c (main): fixed a simple logic bug.  Thanks to
	Barak Pearlmutter (bap@cs.unm.edu) for the patch.

1998-11-06    <bjg@ancho.lanl.gov>

	* used a cast of (int) when attempting to print size_t variables
	with %d

Wed Sep 16 15:08:59 1998  Brian Gough  <bjg@vvv.lanl.gov>

	* gsl-histogram.c (main): made the number of bins
 	optional. If you don't specify it then it uses bins of width 1.
