	* qage_impl.c: started using volatile (selectively) to enforce
 	strict IEEE behavior for the branches where it matters. I was
 	going to use gcc's -ffloat-store option but it didn't work for me.
  	Using volatile is not really a complete solution but is probably
 	close enough for all practical purposes (also it doesn't degrade
 	the performance as much as -ffloat-store would).

	* test.c (main): basic tests of qage are now complete

	* qage_impl.c (gsl_integration_qage_impl): fixed serious bug for
 	index i, which was incremented at the end of the do loop and
 	give an extra undefined entry in the result list!
