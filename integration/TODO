1. check that size / limit is not exceeded 
   - PARTIALLY DONE the checking is missing for the qawo workspace stuff. 
     NEED TO FIX 4 to return an appropriate errro

   -DONE we never check if limit < workspace->limit, which is obviously needed 
 
2. check that routines work correctly for (b, a) and (a, b)

3. check the inner workings of the qawo workspace. I haven't verified
it except by checking the overall result.

4. what is this business with  

  if (error_type > 2)
      error_type--;

5. Take a look at the FIXMEs
